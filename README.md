911 Calls Data Project

Overview:
This repository contains the analysis of emergency (911) calls data, aiming to uncover insights and patterns within the call data. The project is based on the Jupyter notebook 911_Calls_Data_Project.ipynb, which includes data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps.

Technologies Used:
This project leverages several technologies and libraries to perform data analysis and visualization effectively. Below is a list of the key technologies used:

Python: The primary programming language used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
Pandas: A fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.
NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension, NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.
Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
SciPy (Optional): Used for more advanced scientific computing capabilities, such as optimization, regression, interpolation, etc., if applicable to the project.
